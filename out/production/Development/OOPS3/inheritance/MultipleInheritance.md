# ‚òï Multiple Inheritance in Java ‚Äî A Deep Dive

## üîç Overview
**Inheritance** allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another.  
However, when a class tries to inherit from **more than one parent class**, it is called **Multiple Inheritance**.

In Java, **multiple inheritance using classes is not supported** to avoid **ambiguity** and **complexity** ‚Äî  
but it **is supported via interfaces**.

## üß† What is Multiple Inheritance?

### üìñ Definition
> Multiple Inheritance is a feature in which a single class can **inherit from more than one parent class**, thereby acquiring the members of all parent classes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Java Does Not Support Multiple Inheritance (with Classes)

Consider this example üëá

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

// ‚ùå This is illegal in Java
class C extends A, B {
    // Error: Java does not support multiple inheritance
}

```

## Due To Multiple Inheritance not supported in Java  *Interface* Cames into picture 

## üß© The Diamond Problem (Reason for Restriction)
        A
       / \
      B   C
       \ /
        D

If both B and C inherit from A, and D inherits from both B and C,
and all classes define a method show(), then:

‚ùì Which show() should D inherit? From B or C?

This ambiguity is known as the Diamond Problem.
Java avoids this problem by disallowing multiple inheritance of classes.

‚úÖ How Java Solves This ‚Äî Interfaces!
While Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes,
it allows it with interfaces, because interfaces don‚Äôt carry implementation, only method declarations.

So there‚Äôs no ambiguity ‚Äî only contracts to implement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces

```java
interface A {
    void display();
}

interface B {
    void display();
}

class C implements A, B {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method implemented in class C");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.display();
    }
}
‚úÖ Output:
Display method implemented in class C
üß† Explanation:
        ‚Ä¢	Both interfaces A and B declare display().
        ‚Ä¢	Class C implements both and provides a single implementation, resolving ambiguity.
```
## üß© Example: Multiple Inheritance via Interface + Class
```java

class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Show from class A");
    }
}

interface B {
    void print();
}

class C extends A implements B {
    @Override
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Print from interface B implemented in class C");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.show();
        obj.print();
    }
}
‚úÖ Output:
Show from class A
Print from interface B implemented in class C
```
## üß© Multiple Inheritance with Default Methods (Java 8+)
From Java 8 onward, interfaces can have default methods (methods with implementation).
This brings back the potential for ambiguity ‚Äî but Java provides clear rules.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example
```java

interface A {
    default void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from A");
    }
}

interface B {
    default void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from B");
    }
}

class C implements A, B {
    @Override
    public void greet() {
        // Must explicitly choose one or override
        A.super.greet();
        System.out.println("Hello from C");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.greet();
    }
}
‚úÖ Output:
Hello from A
Hello from C
```
